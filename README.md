# ML-Stroke-Likelihood-Prediction-Model

## About the Dataset
The dataset contains records from both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to experience a stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient. We are going to use this dataset to train a ML model that predicts the likelihood of a person having a stroke based on various clinical features.
